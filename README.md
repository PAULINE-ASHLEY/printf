You don’t have to handle the flag characters
You don’t have to handle field width
You don’t have to handle precision
You don’t have to handle the length modifiers

File name for task 0 is : printno.c

1.

i
You don’t have to handle the flag characters

You don’t have to handle precision
You don’t have to handle the length modifiers

File name for task 1 is : print_char.c
